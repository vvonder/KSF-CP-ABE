LIBFENC -- The Functional Encryption Library

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FENC library has a few dependancies: GMP, PBC, and OPENSSL devel libraries, which are 
found at:

    GMP http://www.swox.com/gmp/
    PBC http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/news.html 
    OPENSSL http://www.openssl.org/

The install will also require that you install bison, a GNU parser generator found at:

   http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/

If you forget to install bison, your make will not complete and it will specifically 
complain about not being able to find bison.  
Note that prior to installing new packages, if you have a package manager or software update
application, run a software update on all of your current packages.  This will help
eliminate possible confusion when dependancies don't link as they should.

This library has been tested under Linux (ubuntu, crunchbang, fedora, opensuse) and Unix
(Mac OS X w/ and w/out fink/macports installation, Open Solaris).  You may need to 
appropriately assign library and include paths to satisfy the above dependancies if not 
installed in the default /usr/ location.  See ./configure --help for more help.

The common installation procedure is as follows:
./configure ABI=32 --enable-optimized
make
make install

Note that if GMP, PBC, and OPENSSL were installed in non-standard paths then specify the
following arguments when executing configure.
./configure LDFLAGS=-L"/path/to/library/above" CPPFLAGS=-I"/path/to/includes/above"

See ./configure --help for other options.


BUILDING IN FEDORA 14
------------------------
First, ensure that you have binutils-devel, a gcc compiler, etc.  A simple fix for a cleanly
installed machine would be: yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries".

Once this is done, you will need to install the above library dependencies: GMP, PBC, and
OPENSSL (don't forget bison).  You can either use the Add/Remove Software package manager, 
YUM, RPM if you have the packages, or build via the source from the links above.


BUILDING UNDER UBUNTU 10.10 / CRUNCHBANG 9.04
-------------------------------------------------
By default, the Ubuntu 10 (and previous installs) should already have the appropriate 
developmental tools and libraries installed for installing the library dependancies 
mentioned above: GMP, PBC, and OPENSSL (don't forget bison).  You can use either the Synaptic 
Package Manager under System, dpkg if you have the debian packages, apt-get, or build via
the source from the links above.

As for crunchbang, you will need to install the following the first: sudo apt-get install 
build-essential.  Crunchbang <= 9.04 is based on Ubuntu, so the rest is the same.  If you
are utilizing Crunchbang Statler, than you are dealing with a Debian Squeeze base.  Please
reference dpkg for more help here.

BUILDING IN MAC OS X 10.6
----------------------------
Above installation procedure applies to the Mac OS X environment.

BUILDING PBC IN MULTI-ARCHITECTURE CPUs
---------------------------------------
To specify a particular architecture, pass the following arguments to the configure script:
./configure CC="gcc -arch i386" CXX="g++ -arch i386"
OR
./configure CC="gcc -arch x86_64" CXX="g++ -arch x86_64" 
OR 
./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
            CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
	    CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E" \
	    (for both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures)

Then, proceed with "make" and "make install".

KNOWN ISSUES USING MAC PORTS
----------------------------
Under the 64-bit Linux environment, we noted a problem with linking libraries that
were installed to /usr/local/lib/.  To mitigate this error, attempt a sudo ldconfig as your
first step.  This should link your libraries in.

Under MacOSX environment, if you have installed GMP via macports, you will run into a 
build error in libfenc concerning a missing gmp.h include.  To mitigate this error you 
will need to adjust the header, pbc.h, in the PBC source ./include/.  Modify the 
#include <gmp.h> to "/opt/local/include/gmp.h".
